//! # Memory tools — the three `Tool` impls from Phase 6 task 3.
//!
//! [`MemoryReadTool`], [`MemoryWriteTool`], and [`MemoryForgetTool`]
//! are the user-facing surface of D1's "memory is a tool, not ambient
//! system" commitment. Each one wraps an `Arc<dyn Memory>` (so the
//! same substrate can be driven by any implementation — redb in
//! production, [`crate::InMemoryMemory`] in tests), owns its
//! pre-built input schema, and routes every call through the
//! capability-typed [`aivyx_core::Tool`] trait that the turn loop
//! already enforces.
//!
//! ## Q5 resolution (for future archaeologists)
//!
//! Phase 6 entered open on "does `Tool::required_scope` need an
//! `input: &Value` parameter?" A careful read of `aivyx-core` at task
//! 3 start revealed that Phase 1's task 3 already folded the R1
//! refinement into the live trait: `fn required_scope(&self, input:
//! &serde_json::Value) -> Scope` has been shipped since commit
//! `33012be`. Phase 4's `FsReadTool` has been using the signature for
//! two phases. No DESIGN.md amendment needed; the five-phase
//! empty-diff streak rolls forward to six. The stale DESIGN.md
//! line-1038 note is a known drift marker and stays as-is per the
//! "evidence-driven amendments" discipline — a future phase that
//! *actually* amends D3 will clean it up in the same diff.
//!
//! ## Q3 resolution — topic filter semantics
//!
//! `memory.read` requires a topic. The `"*"` sentinel from the Phase
//! 6 open-question writeup is **not** implemented in this task; the
//! substrate itself has no cross-topic scan primitive, and the audit
//! story for "one call surfaces arbitrary state" is exactly the kind
//! of thing that deserves deliberate design rather than a reserved
//! string squeezed in at task 3. If Phase 7+ wants it, the call site
//! will be `MemoryReadTool::execute`, not a substrate change. This is
//! in line with option (1) from Phase 6's Q3: require a topic
//! argument, force the planner to name what it recalls.
//!
//! ## Scope derivation (the R1 payoff)
//!
//! Each tool derives a scope that *mentions* the specific topic the
//! call will touch, so that an agent holding `memory.read:topic:notes`
//! cannot use `memory.read` to peek at topic `secrets`. The qualifier
//! shape matches DESIGN.md's D4 taxonomy: `<base>:topic:<topic>`.
//! Malformed input (missing topic, wrong type) routes to a "deny
//! scope" — a scope no agent can possibly hold, which the turn
//! loop's scope gate converts into `ToolOutcome::Denied` before
//! `execute` ever runs. This is exactly the Phase 4 `FsReadTool`
//! pattern; the only shift is that memory uses a topic qualifier
//! instead of a path qualifier.
//!
//! The "deny scope" construction has a subtlety: it must still be a
//! *valid* `Scope` (the `Tool` trait's return type is bare `Scope`,
//! not `Result`), and its `base` must be one of `aivyx-capability`'s
//! `KNOWN_BASES` or `Scope::parse` refuses to build it. The reserved
//! sentinel qualifier `topic:\x00denied` meets both constraints: the
//! base is real (`memory.read`), so the parse succeeds, but no agent
//! will ever be granted a scope with a NUL-containing qualifier, so
//! the gate denies every call that lands on it. Same trick as
//! Phase 4's fs deny scope, adapted to this crate's qualifier shape.
//!
//! ## What does NOT happen here
//!
//! - **No scope checking.** The turn loop's scope gate in
//!   `aivyx-core` is the *only* thing that compares `required_scope`
//!   against the agent's held capabilities. `execute` trusts that
//!   it was invoked with an in-scope call — see the `FsReadTool`
//!   docstring for the same explicit reliance.
//! - **No audit writes.** Each tool builds an `AuditTag::MemoryAccess`
//!   for the turn loop to emit, but this task does not wire
//!   audit-on-execute directly — that's the turn loop's job via
//!   `ToolContext::audit`. The tools **do** emit a MemoryAccess
//!   event at the start of `execute`, so the audit chain records
//!   every memory touch even when the substrate no-ops (e.g., a
//!   read of a never-written topic).
//! - **No topic validation beyond non-empty.** UTF-8 well-formedness
//!   is already guaranteed by the `String` type, and the substrate
//!   itself rejects `EmptyTopic`. Topic length caps, character
//!   restrictions, and reserved prefixes are deferred to Phase 7+
//!   if real-world usage surfaces a need.
