//! Relay composition + the auditable crossing shape (FED.3 / Chapter Passport PP.3).
//!
//! The wire **verbs** live in the wasm-clean [`aivyx_ipc::federation`]
//! ([`RelayRequest`] / `RelayResponse`); this module composes them with the
//! [`Identity`] signing envelope (PP.1) into a signed frame, and defines the
//! forensic **shape** of a crossing for the audit chain (FED.0 §6).
//!
//! What is **not** here (deferred): a transport / relay server, and the live
//! `AuditEvent::FederationCrossing` emission. The audit chain has established
//! forward-compat patterns (serde-default fields), so its *emission* can land
//! when a crossing actually executes (with transport); the irreversible part —
//! the wire protocol — is locked now. [`Crossing`] pins the audit *fields* so
//! that emission is a mechanical wiring step, not a redesign.
