//! Per-role capability envelope assembly.
//!
//! This module hosts [`assemble_role_envelope`], the pure function
//! that walks a role's `parent_role` chain and produces the
//! effective `CapabilitySet` the runtime should grant when the
//! named role is active.
//!
//! ## History
//!
//! The function was written in Phase 13 Task 2 (the per-role
//! capability envelope migration) and originally lived inside
//! `src/bin/aivyx.rs` as a binary-private free fn. Phase 13 Task 3
//! recorded the lift into this lib module as a deferral, tagged
//! "clean cut, not a refactor" — the fn has no binary-specific
//! state, it takes only `aivyx_config::Role`, a `BTreeMap` role
//! table, and a backcompat floor scope slice.
//!
//! Phase 14 Task 1 consumed that deferral. The fn moved here
//! verbatim; the Phase 13 binary-internal regression tests against
//! `examples/aivyx.toml` stayed in `src/bin/aivyx.rs` and now call
//! through to this module via `aivyx_channel::assemble_role_
//! envelope`. A small set of pure-fn unit tests against hand-rolled
//! `Role` values (no TOML loader in the call path) lives at the
//! bottom of this file.
//!
//! ## Why the lift mattered
//!
//! Phase 14's main deliverable is sub-agent role-switching
//! (**PRODUCT.md P1**), which needs the envelope assembler as a
//! library-reachable function: a `role.switch` tool constructing a
//! child agent at turn-runtime cannot reach into the binary's
//! private fn, and duplicating the walk inside the tool would
//! violate the "structurally impossible escalation" rule
//! (**PRODUCT.md P1.3**) by giving the tool a second place to
//! synthesize a `CapabilitySet`. The lift makes the walker the
//! single construction path for every downstream caller.

/// Phase 13 Task 2 — assemble the effective capability envelope
/// for an active role by walking its `parent_role` chain.
///
/// **Algorithm.** Starting from `active`, walk up the chain
/// through `roles`, collecting each role's declared
/// `capability_scopes`. At each level:
///
/// - If the role's `capability_scopes` is non-empty, use it as
///   declared.
/// - If empty, substitute `backcompat_floor`. This is the **Q6
///   minimal backcompat floor**: a role that declares no
///   envelope inherits whatever the binary used to grant
///   pre-Phase-13 (the hard-coded `aivyx.rs:907–934` vector,
///   shrunk to the Phase 1–10 zero-config defaults). The floor
///   substitution happens at every empty level, not just at
///   the root, so a chain of empty roles all see the same
///   floor and intersect to itself — preserving Phase 11
///   `tool_allowlist`-narrows-broad-floor backcompat exactly.
///
/// The resulting per-level scope sets are then folded
/// pairwise via `CapabilitySet::intersect` from leaf toward
/// root. Intersection under D4 prefix-attenuation keeps the
/// **narrower** of two scopes that share a base (the child's
/// `fs.read:/tmp/**` survives intersection with the parent's
/// `fs.read`), which is the structural meaning of P7's
/// "child can attenuate, never widen" rule.
///
/// **Why leaf-to-root, not root-to-leaf.** Both directions
/// produce the same final set under intersection (the operation
/// is commutative and associative), but the leaf-to-root walk
/// matches how an operator reads the config — "this role,
/// then its parent, then its grandparent" — and keeps the
/// "active role" the natural starting point.
///
/// **Trust ceiling intersection happens at the call site, not
/// here.** `assemble_role_envelope` is purely about scope-set
/// inheritance; the Q3 `trust_ceiling.default_ceiling()` layer
/// composes on top via a separate `intersect` call right
/// before the envelope is handed to the channel branch. This
/// keeps the function's contract narrow: "given a role tree
/// and a backcompat floor, what scopes does this role declare
/// it wants?"
///
/// **Cycle safety.** `aivyx_config::validate_role_inheritance`
/// has already rejected cycles by the time this function runs,
/// so an unbounded `while let Some(parent)` walk is safe. As
/// belt-and-suspenders, the loop carries a depth counter and
/// bails after [`MAX_INHERITANCE_DEPTH`] to make a future
/// validator regression loud rather than infinite-looping a
/// production process.

    //! Pure-fn unit tests against hand-rolled `Role` values. These
    //! deliberately bypass the TOML loader so the walker's
    //! contract can be exercised without a config-file round-trip
    //! in the call path — the binary-internal regression tests in
    //! `src/bin/aivyx.rs` pin the integration, these pin the
    //! pure-fn contract.
    //!
    //! Three shapes covered:
    //!
    //! 1. **Leaf-only** — `active` has no parent; the walker
    //!    returns `active`'s declared set unchanged.
    //! 2. **Clean parent + child attenuation** — child drops one
    //!    scope the parent declares; the walker returns the
    //!    child's declared set (intersection narrows, not
    //!    widens).
    //! 3. **Empty-child surprise** — child declares
    //!    `capability_scopes = []`; the walker substitutes the
    //!    backcompat floor for the child level and intersects
    //!    against the parent. This is the Phase 13 Task 2
    //!    correction-block case; pinning it here (not just in
    //!    the binary) means a future refactor that accidentally
    //!    aligned the empty-child and parent envelopes would
    //!    break this test first, before the binary's
    //!    `examples/aivyx.toml` regression ever runs.
