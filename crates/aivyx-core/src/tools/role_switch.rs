//! `RoleSwitchTool` — Phase 14 sub-agent role-switching primitive
//! (**PRODUCT.md P1**).
//!
//! ## What it does (Task 3 shape)
//!
//! Task 2 shipped the **scope plumbing, tool registration, and
//! dispatch gate**. Task 3 replaces the placeholder `execute` body
//! with a real inline sub-session: the tool owns an optional
//! `child_factory` closure, captured at session-construction time,
//! that knows how to build a fully-wired child `ConcreteAgent` for
//! any declared role. When `execute` fires (the scope gate has
//! already passed by then), the tool calls the factory with the
//! `target` role name, runs `child.turn(Message::text(session_id,
//! task), ctx.channel).await` synchronously, and returns the child's
//! final message as the `ToolOutcome::Completed` output JSON.
//!
//! ## Why the child reuses the parent's channel
//!
//! The child agent runs on `ctx.channel` — the same
//! `&dyn ChannelContext` the parent is using. This is intentional:
//!
//! - **Writer sharing**: every child stream event lands in the same
//!   terminal the parent's events lands in, in event-emission order.
//!   The user sees a seamless transcript with no "child output
//!   started / stopped" framing.
//! - **Cancellation sharing**: a ctrl-C at the user's terminal
//!   cancels the channel's token, and both the parent's deadline
//!   task (waiting to fire) and the child's in-flight turn observe
//!   it. The child aborts, the parent's observation of the tool
//!   outcome is `Cancelled`, and the parent's turn loop then
//!   short-circuits at the next top-of-loop cancellation check.
//!   The parent doesn't need to synthesize a cancellation path of
//!   its own.
//! - **Trust tier stability**: `channel.trust_tier()` is constant
//!   for the channel's lifetime, so the child's turn-start
//!   intersection with `tier.default_ceiling()` produces the same
//!   tier ceiling the parent is operating under. Combined with the
//!   child's declared envelope (which was already attenuated against
//!   the parent's chain by `assemble_role_envelope`), this gives the
//!   PRODUCT.md P1.3 "structurally impossible escalation" guarantee:
//!   the child cannot hold any scope the parent did not transitively
//!   grant, because (a) `assemble_role_envelope` walks leaf-to-root
//!   and intersects, and (b) the tier ceiling is identical.
//!
//! ## Why the dispatch gate is free
//!
//! `Tool::required_scope(&input)` is documented as pure and is
//! called by the turn loop **before** `execute` runs. For
//! `role.switch`, the function just reads `input["target"]` and
//! returns `Scope::parse(&format!("role.switch:{target}"))`. The
//! loop's existing scope gate then intersects the derived scope
//! with the agent's effective capability set and short-circuits
//! to `ToolOutcome::Denied { scope, held }` if the intersection
//! is empty. **No explicit denial path is written inside
//! `execute`** — it falls out of the existing architecture.
//!
//! ## Why the factory is `Option`al
//!
//! The unit tests in this module build a bare `RoleSwitchTool` with
//! no factory and pin the `required_scope` contract (the dispatch
//! gate's input, essentially) without a live session layer. In real
//! use, the session layer constructs the tool with
//! `::with_child_factory(...)` before pushing it into the
//! `ToolRegistry`. A factory-less tool that actually reaches
//! `execute` returns a `Failed` outcome — "role.switch was invoked
//! but no session is wired for sub-sessions" — rather than
//! panicking, so a misconfigured test path surfaces cleanly.
//!
//! ## Input shape
//!
//! ```json
//! { "target": "researcher", "task": "read file X and summarize" }
//! ```
//!
//! - `target`: the role name to switch into. Must name a role the
//!   `child_factory` knows about; unknown targets surface as a
//!   `Failed` outcome with a human-readable detail.
//! - `task`: the initial user message the child's planner sees.
//!   Q2's "clean-slate child conversation history" decision means
//!   nothing else crosses the boundary.

/// ## Why the factory lives behind `OnceLock`
///
/// `RoleSwitchTool` is held in the `ToolRegistry` as `Arc<dyn Tool>`,
/// which means the session layer has no mutable path to the tool
/// after the registry is built. The factory closure, however, needs
/// to be wired **after** the registry exists, because the child
/// agent it produces must reuse the same tool registry the parent
/// is running against (sub-sessions reuse the tool set by
/// construction — see PRODUCT.md P1's "same process, single
/// execution pointer" line).
///
/// The circular dependency — factory needs the registry; registry
/// needs the tool — is broken by `OnceLock<Arc<ChildAgentFactory>>`:
///
/// 1. Session layer creates `Arc::new(RoleSwitchTool::new())` —
///    factory slot is empty.
/// 2. Session layer pushes a clone of that `Arc` into `tool_list`
///    (upcast to `Arc<dyn Tool>`) and builds `ToolRegistry`.
/// 3. Session layer builds the factory closure, capturing
///    `Arc::clone(&tools)` and all the other collaborators.
/// 4. Session layer calls `role_switch_tool.set_child_factory(...)`
///    on the *outer* `Arc<RoleSwitchTool>` handle. Because the
///    registry's copy and the outer handle are the same `Arc`, the
///    `OnceLock::set` is visible through both.
///
/// `OnceLock` is the right primitive here (not `Mutex`, not `RwLock`):
/// the factory is written exactly once at startup and read many
/// times from the tool's `execute`, so set-once semantics are exact
/// and the read path avoids any locking overhead.
