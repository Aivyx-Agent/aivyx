# Aivyx — server-appliance image (Chapter Harbor, HB.1).
#
# Multi-stage: a Rust builder compiles the daemon + every tool-process binary,
# then a slim Debian runtime carries just the binaries + the appliance config.
# The Studio web bundle is already embedded in the `aivyx-pa` binary at compile
# time (from the committed crates/aivyx-web/dist/), so no Node/dx is needed here.
#
# TLS is rustls (pure-Rust) and crypto is RustCrypto — no OpenSSL — so the
# runtime needs only ca-certificates. A musl/distroless static image is a future
# size optimization (docs/DOCKER.md F-2); debian-slim is the reliable default.
#
# Build:  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t aivyx:dev .
# Run:    docker compose up    (see docker-compose.yml)

# Copy the whole workspace. aivyx-web (wasm) is excluded from default-members,
# so the binary builds below never try to compile it; the daemon embeds the
# pre-built, committed dist/ bundle.
COPY . .

# Build the daemon + all Chapter F/G tool-process binaries in one pass, then copy
# the release artifacts to /out for the runtime stage.
#
# No BuildKit cache mounts — the legacy builder works everywhere (buildx is
# optional). Rebuilds recompile from scratch; `docker buildx build` with
# `--mount=type=cache` is a speed optimization left to the operator.
