//! `aivyx-vertical-sdk` — the **stable contract surface for vertical packs**.
//!
//! A vertical pack (the kitchen pack is the open reference example) is *config
//! and tools over the free engine*, never a fork. But until now packs reached
//! straight into the engine internals (`aivyx-core`, `aivyx-team`,
//! `aivyx-capability`, `aivyx-tool`) so every core refactor risked breaking
//! every paid pack. This crate is the seam that fixes that: it re-exports a
//! **curated, semver-stable subset** of the engine, and a pack depends on this
//! crate alone.
//!
//! ## The contract
//!
//! Everything a pack is allowed to touch lives under one of three modules:
//!
//! - [`capability`] — declare the scopes a tool requires ([`Scope`],
//!   [`TrustTier`]).
//! - [`team`] — the shape of a pack's Nonagon: [`TeamConfig`] + members +
//!   the [`MissionPlan`] it runs, plus [`attenuate_for_member`] for NT-02
//!   least-privilege.
//! - [`tool`] — implement the [`Tool`] trait and run a tool-process via
//!   [`run_multi_tool_subprocess`] (the Chapter F/G substrate pattern).
//!
//! Or pull the lot in with `use aivyx_vertical_sdk::prelude::*;`.
//!
//! ## Stability promise
//!
//! Items re-exported here are the pack-facing API. They change only with a
//! deliberate SDK version bump, even when the underlying engine crate moves.
//! Anything *not* re-exported here is engine-internal and off-limits to packs —
//! if a pack needs something new from the engine, add it to this facade first
//! (one reviewed place) rather than depending on the engine crate directly.
//!
