//! Human-readable rendering of a role's effective capability
//! envelope — the library-side home for the `--print-role` debug
//! surface.
//!
//! ## History
//!
//! [`render_role_envelope`], [`ChannelKind`], and the two private
//! helpers below (`build_display_floor`, `drop_reason_for`) were
//! written in Phase 13 Task 4 (`--print-role` first landed) and
//! extended in Phase 14 Task 4 (reachable role.switch target
//! enumerator). They all originally lived inside
//! `crates/aivyx-channel/src/bin/aivyx.rs` as binary-private
//! items. Phase 14 Task 5 recorded the lift into the channel
//! library as an optional cleanup; Phase 15 Task 3 picks that
//! cleanup up and executes it.
//!
//! ## Why the lift
//!
//! Two reasons, neither structural on its own but both
//! compounding:
//!
//! 1. **Test reach.** While the renderer was binary-private, its
//!    tests had to live inside `src/bin/aivyx.rs`'s `mod tests`
//!    (integration tests cannot reach binary internals in Rust).
//!    The binary's test module has been the single longest section
//!    in the crate since Phase 10 and the renderer's seven
//!    functional tests made it noticeably worse. Lifting the
//!    renderer makes those tests reachable from
//!    `crates/aivyx-channel/tests/role_render_e2e.rs`, which
//!    trims the binary and puts the tests next to their siblings.
//!
//! 2. **Cross-crate reachability.** Future downstream consumers
//!    (the Daemon Migration milestone's IPC frontends, for one)
//!    will need the "explain a role's effective envelope" surface
//!    without depending on the `aivyx` binary. Keeping it
//!    library-side from Phase 15 onward avoids a second lift later.
//!
//! ## Surface
//!
//! - [`ChannelKind`] — which adapter a session runs on. The
//!   renderer uses it to decide whether `shell.exec` goes into
//!   the displayed backcompat floor (Local: yes, Telegram: no),
//!   mirroring the registration-time gate
//!   `build_shell_exec_for_channel` applies in the binary.
//! - [`render_role_envelope`] — pure function that takes a role
//!   name, an [`AivyxConfig`], and a [`ChannelKind`], and returns
//!   a multi-section string suitable for `println!` or for the
//!   integration tests in `tests/role_render_e2e.rs`. Errors on
//!   unknown role names with a typed list of the known names.
//!
//! The two helpers are deliberately module-private: they are
//! implementation details of `render_role_envelope` and no
//! caller outside this file should be reaching for them.
