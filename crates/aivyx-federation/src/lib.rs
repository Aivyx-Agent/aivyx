//! # Aivyx Federation — the Identity & Cross-Boundary Trust keystone
//!
//! Chapter **Passport** (FED.1–5). This crate is the open-core **trust
//! substrate** for agent-to-agent interaction across an operator boundary —
//! the one primitive `VISION.md` says to *get right early* because it cannot be
//! safely retrofitted. The design contract is `docs/FEDERATION.md` (FED.0).
//!
//! The central insight: **"a network of agents is a Nonagon team with the trust
//! boundary moved."** Same delegation, attenuation, gates, and audit; the only
//! new thing is *identity and trust at the boundary between operators*. So this
//! crate generalizes the local-team machinery
//! ([`aivyx_capability::Scope`] attenuation, NT-02) across that boundary.
//!
//! ## Scope of this crate (the discipline line)
//!
//! This is the **substrate only** — identity, per-peer trust + attenuation, the
//! relay protocol *shape*, peer-content provenance/sandboxing, and operator
//! consent gating. Everything **network-shaped** — peer discovery, a transport
//! / relay server, reputation, and the agent-hiring economics — is the *private
//! Nexus product*, built last on an installed base (`docs/FEDERATION.md` §10).
//! Nothing here assumes a transport or a topology.
//!
//! ## Modernization (Chapter Passport PP.0)
//!
//! Salvaged and modernized from the pre-rebuild `aivyx-federation` onto the new
//! core:
//! - old `aivyx_core::AutonomyTier` → Reins [`AutonomyLevel`](aivyx_config) ceiling;
//! - old free-string scopes → [`aivyx_capability::Scope`];
//! - old HTTP relay/client → deferred (transport is the Nexus product);
//! - every crossing routes onto `aivyx-audit` (PP.3).
//!
//! ## Module map (filled phase by phase)
//!
//! - [`identity`] — PP.1: operator-owned Ed25519 keypair + signed,
//!   replay-guarded request envelope.
//! - [`trust`] — PP.2: per-peer `TrustPolicy` (deny-by-default) + the
//!   cross-operator attenuation (`effective = asked ∩ policy ∩ ceiling ∩ cap`).
//! - [`relay`] — PP.3: compose the wasm-clean relay verbs
//!   ([`aivyx_ipc::federation`]) with the signing envelope; the auditable
//!   [`Crossing`](relay::Crossing) shape (live emission deferred with transport).
